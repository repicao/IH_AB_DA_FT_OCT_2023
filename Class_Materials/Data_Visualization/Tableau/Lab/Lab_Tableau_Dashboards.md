# Lab Tableau Dashboard

Using the Superstore Dataset [Data](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1EbKazJek0xXM8UUZYsKaUALlSjjM6bwJ), you are required to build a Dashboard using Tableau that gives better insights for the business executives about the overall performance of the business.

- latest year KPIs:
   - total profit
   - total sales
   - total discount
   - (optional):  show the YoY growth rate ( comparing the current measure with the prior year)
- show the quarterly sales over years
- show the quarterly profit over years
- optional: profit margin(%) drilled down by sub-category
- top 3 most profitable "corporate" customers.
- top 3 most profitable product sub categories in every region.
- (optional): show the return rate(orders returned) by sub-category by region
- (optional): any chart/s that you may think that can show an important insight/pattern about the business performance. 


The dashboard should have a clean and well readable design. You may decide to split the dashboard into two dashboards ( Executive and Operational (orders, customers, etc)) if it is needed.
